As a Quality Assurance expert, I've analyzed the visitor feedback. The core issues stem from a lack of precise contextual understanding, inaccurate environmental perception, and insufficient adaptability to user corrections.

Here are actionable guidelines for the AgenticAI to more effectively handle complex visitor requests:

### AgenticAI Guidelines for Complex Visitor Requests

These guidelines aim to improve the AI's situational awareness, analytical depth, and adaptive response capabilities.

1.  **Enhanced Contextual Visual Perception:**
	*   **Action:** When processing visual input (images/video), the AI *must* perform a multi-layered analysis beyond basic object recognition. This includes:
		*   **Detailed Element Identification:** Identify specific visual elements and their *functional purpose* (e.g., confirming an airport entrance vs. just a building, recognizing specific signage).
		*   **Precise Alphanumeric Extraction & Interpretation:** Accurately extract and interpret all alphanumeric codes (e.g., gate numbers, zone IDs) with high fidelity, paying close attention to distinguishing similar characters (e.g., 'C' vs. 'E').
		*   **Spatial Contextualization:** Infer nuanced spatial relationships and location descriptions (e.g., "outside the terminal building" vs. "at the main entrance" vs. "inside near the entrance").
	*   **Outcome:** Provide comprehensive, contextually rich descriptions and proactively offer further assistance or information directly related to detected visual cues.

2.  **Dynamic & Precise Location-Aware Filtering:**
	*   **Action:**
		*   **Accurate Location Pinpointing:** Establish and continuously update the visitor's precise location (e.g., current zone ID, floor, indoor/outdoor status) using all available data (visual analysis, explicit user statements, historical context).
		*   **Contextual "Nearby" Interpretation:** For location-dependent queries (e.g., "kiosk nearby," "restrooms"), rigorously filter and prioritize results based on the *actual, verified proximity* to the visitor's current location.
		*   **Relevant Prioritization:** Present the closest and most relevant options first. Avoid listing options that are clearly not "nearby" (e.g., on different floors or distant zones) unless the visitor explicitly requests a broader search.
	*   **Outcome:** Deliver highly personalized and relevant location-based information, minimizing irrelevant suggestions and visitor frustration.

3.  **Robust Error Correction and Contextual State Management:**
	*   **Action:** When a visitor explicitly corrects the AI's understanding (particularly concerning location, identified elements, or interpreted context):
		*   **Acknowledge & Apologize:** Immediately acknowledge the correction and politely apologize for the initial misidentification.
		*   **Instant State Update:** Update the visitor's profile and current contextual state (e.g., location, zone ID, indoor/outdoor status) with the corrected information *without delay*.
		*   **Re-engage with Corrected Context:** Re-engage the visitor using the newly established, correct context to continue the interaction.
	*   **Outcome:** Build and maintain visitor trust, ensure an accurate understanding of the visitor's situation, and prevent compounding errors.

4.  **Proactive Clarification and Data Re-analysis for Ambiguity:**
	*   **Action:** If there is ambiguity in a request (e.g., an unquantified "nearby") or if initial data analysis yields low-confidence results (e.g., uncertain location identification from an image or conflicting information):
		*   **Seek Clarification:** Proactively ask the visitor for specific clarification or additional details (e.g., "Do you mean within 50 meters, or on this floor?", "Could you confirm if you are inside or outside the terminal?").
		*   **Trigger Re-analysis:** Automatically trigger a re-analysis of available input (e.g., re-process images with higher scrutiny, cross-reference data points) to resolve uncertainty before providing a definitive response.
	*   **Outcome:** Ensure an accurate interpretation of visitor intent and context, leading to more precise, helpful, and confident responses.
