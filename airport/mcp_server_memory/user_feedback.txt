{"feedback":"bad","ideal_processing_steps":"1. Understand the user's current location or context (e.g., zone 2F-D-1-e). 2. When 'nearby' is specified, prioritize amenities within a very close proximity to the user's current location. 3. If multiple 'nearby' options exist, present the closest one(s) first, or ask for clarification on preferred type of kiosk. 4. Avoid listing amenities that are clearly not 'nearby' (e.g., on a different floor or distant zone) unless explicitly requested for a broader search.","points":"The user explicitly stated 'nearby' in their query, but the provided list of kiosks included locations that were not considered 'nearby' by the user, leading to frustration. The user's current location (2F-D-1-e) should have been used to filter the results more effectively.","request":"Kiosk nearby","response":"Kiosks are available at the following locations: 2F-D-10-w, 2F-D-11-w, 2F-D-7-e (self-service and check-in kiosks), 2F-D-9-e (information kiosks), 2F-D-6-w, and 3F-E-2-e.","visitor_id":"Visitor1"}
