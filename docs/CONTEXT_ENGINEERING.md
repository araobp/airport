# Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering 

(Generated by Gemini)

The YouTube video titled "Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering: Demystifying the two disciplines" from IBM provides a detailed explanation of the two concepts.

The video explains that **prompt engineering** is the process of writing input text to a large language model (LLM), using techniques like role assignment, few-shot examples, Chain of Thought (CoT), and constraint setting. An example is an AI agent named Graham who books travel [[00:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=32)]. It's described as the "craft of wording the instruction itself" [[02:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=125)].

In contrast, **context engineering** is a broader, system-level discipline that programmatically assembles all the information the LLM sees, including prompts, retrieved documents, memory, and tools [[00:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=12)]. Key components include:
* **Memory:** Short-term (summarizing conversations) or long-term (using vector databases for user preferences) [[04:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=257)].
* **State Management:** Tracking progress in multi-step tasks [[04:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=294)].
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Connecting an agent to dynamic knowledge sources [[05:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=325)].
* **Tool Access:** Giving the LLM the ability to perform actions like calling APIs or executing code [[06:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=365)].

The video concludes that prompt engineering gives you "better questions," while context engineering gives you "better systems" [[07:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0E3EUb8-8&t=432)].
