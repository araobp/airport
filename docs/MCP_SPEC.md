# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Specification for ABC International Airport

**Note:** This specification was generated by the Gemini AI model.

ABC International Airport (ABC) is a prime candidate for implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance its "smart airport" initiatives, which already include advanced technologies like biometrics, self-service kiosks, and AI-powered operations. MCP can act as the unifying layer for these diverse systems, allowing AI to leverage them more effectively for improved passenger experience, operational efficiency, and security.

(Note: ABC is a fictional name.)

Here's how MCP could be applied at ABC International Airport:

### 1. Enhanced Passenger Experience with AI-Native Assistance:

**Tools:**

-   `flight_status_check(flight_number: str, date: str)`: An AI assistant can use this tool to provide real-time updates on flight delays, gate changes, or boarding times.
-   `maps_to_gate(gate_number: str)`: Integrates with ABC's indoor navigation systems to guide passengers using an AI chatbot or digital signage.
-   `find_amenity(type: str, terminal: str)`: Helps passengers locate restrooms, restaurants, lounges, or duty-free shops, potentially even booking reservations (e.g., `book_restaurant_table(restaurant_id: str, time: str, guests: int)`).
-   `translate_phrase(text: str, target_language: str)`: Provides on-the-spot translation for non-Japanese speaking passengers interacting with airport staff or signage.
-   `report_lost_item(description: str, location: str)`: Allows passengers to quickly report lost luggage or personal items via an AI interface.

**Resources:**

-   `airport_map://{terminal_id}`: Provides dynamic, up-to-date maps with real-time congestion data, amenity locations, and security wait times.
-   `boarding_pass://{passenger_id}`: Securely provides AI agents with passenger's boarding pass details (flight number, seat, boarding time) for personalized assistance.
-   `food_options://{terminal_id}/{cuisine_type}`: Dynamic list of dining options filtered by terminal, cuisine, or dietary restrictions, including current opening hours and estimated wait times.
-   `train_schedule://ABC_express_to_tokyo`: Real-time train schedules and platform information for airport access.

### 2. Optimized Airport Operations and Management:

**Tools:**

-   `assign_gate(flight_id: str, new_gate: str)`: Allows an AI-powered operations system to dynamically re-assign gates based on real-time factors like delays, maintenance, or passenger flow, potentially minimizing taxi times.
-   `dispatch_baggage_handler(flight_id: str, priority: str)`: Automatically dispatches personnel for baggage handling based on flight arrival, departure, and priority.
-   `alert_security(incident_type: str, location: str)`: AI systems monitoring surveillance feeds or sensor data can use this tool to alert security personnel to anomalies or incidents.
-   `adjust_lighting(zone_id: str, intensity: int)`: For energy management, AI can dynamically adjust lighting in different terminal zones based on passenger density or natural light.
-   `update_display_boards(display_id: str, content: json)`: Allows AI to update flight information display systems instantly.

**Resources:**

-   `realtime_traffic://{zone_id}`: Live data on passenger traffic within terminals, security checkpoints, and immigration lines, enabling AI to predict bottlenecks and suggest re-routing.
-   `baggage_flow://{belt_id}/status`: Real-time status of baggage conveyor belts, detecting potential jams or slowdowns.
-   `aircraft_positions://live`: Live aircraft positioning data on ABC's runways and taxiways for air traffic control assistance.
-   `weather_forecast://ABC_airport/next_24h`: Real-time and predictive weather data impacting flight operations.
-   `staff_availability://{department_id}`: Anonymous data on available staff in different airport departments for efficient resource allocation.

### 3. Enhanced Security and Safety:

**Tools:**

-   `lock_door(door_id: str)`: In an emergency, an AI system can trigger lockdown protocols for specific areas.
-   `activate_alarm(alarm_zone: str)`: Trigger alarms in response to detected threats.
-   `deploy_emergency_response(team_type: str, location: str)`: AI can assist in coordinating emergency response teams.
-   `patrol(area: str)`: Instructs a security robot to patrol a specific area.

**Resources:**

-   `security_feed://{camera_id}/live`: Real-time, anonymized video streams from security cameras (with privacy safeguards) for AI-driven anomaly detection.
-   `access_logs://{area_id}/last_hour}`: Logs of access control systems to monitor unauthorized entries.
-   `sensor_data://{sensor_type}/realtime`: Readings from smoke detectors, chemical sensors, or structural health monitors.
-   `security_robot_status://{robot_id}`: Real-time status of a security robot, including its location, battery level, and current activity.

### 4. Predictive Maintenance and Infrastructure Management:

**Tools:**

-   `schedule_maintenance(equipment_id: str, type: str, date: str)`: AI can predict equipment failures (e.g., HVAC, baggage systems, escalators) and use this tool to schedule preventative maintenance.
-   `order_spare_part(part_id: str, quantity: int)`: If an AI predicts a component failure, it can automatically trigger an order for a replacement.

**Resources:**

-   `equipment_status://{equipment_id}`: Real-time operational data from all airport machinery, including performance metrics, error codes, and historical usage.
-   `maintenance_log://{equipment_id}`: History of past maintenance, repairs, and part replacements.
-   `utility_consumption://{zone_id}/hourly`: Data on electricity, water, and gas consumption for energy optimization and anomaly detection.

## Why MCP is particularly beneficial for ABC:

### Existing Smart Airport Initiatives

ABC already invests heavily in smart technologies (biometrics, self-service, AI for operations). MCP provides a cohesive framework to integrate these disparate systems and leverage their data more effectively with advanced AI.

### High Passenger Volume

As a major international hub, ABC experiences high passenger traffic. MCP-powered AI can help manage this flow, reduce bottlenecks, and personalize experiences at scale.

### Disruption Management

Airports are highly susceptible to disruptions (weather, technical issues, security threats). MCP allows AI to rapidly access real-time data and trigger appropriate tools for efficient disruption recovery.

### Complex Ecosystem

Airports involve numerous stakeholders (airlines, ground handlers, customs, immigration, retail, security). MCP can provide a common language for these entities to share and act upon contextual information with AI.

By implementing MCP, ABC International Airport could move towards a truly intelligent, adaptive, and highly efficient operational model, further enhancing its reputation as a leading smart airport.
