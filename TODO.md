You: What amenities does the airport lack?
AI: Based on the image, this area of the airport appears to lack many common amenities. I don't see any:

*   Seating for passengers
*   Information desks or clear signage
*   Shops or restaurants
*   Baggage claim carousels
*   Security checkpoints
*   Restrooms
*   Departure or arrival boards
*   Any decorative elements or plants to make the space feel more inviting.

It looks like a very stark and empty space, suggesting a lack of functional airport facilities within this particular view.
